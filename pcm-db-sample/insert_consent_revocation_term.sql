If I sign this form as the Patient\'s Legal Representative, I understand that all references in this form to \"me\" or \"my\" refer to the Patient.\n\nBy withdrawing my Consent, I understand that:\n\n	1. I Deny Consent for all Participants to access my electronic health information through Consent2Share for any purpose, EXCEPT in a medical emergency.\n	2. Health care provider and health insurers that I am enrolled with will no longer be able to access health information about me through Consent2Share, except in an emergency.\n	3. The Withdrawal of Consent will not affect the exchange of my health information while my Consent was in effect.\n	4. No Consent2Share participating provider will deny me medical care and my insurance eligibility will not be affected based on my Withdrawal of Consent.\n	5. If I wish to reinstate Consent, I may do so by signing and completing a new Patient Consent form and returning it to a participating provider or payer.\n	6. Revoking my Consent does not prevent my health care provider from submitting claims to my health insurer for reimbursement for services rendered to me in reliance on the Consent while it was in effect.\n	7. I understand that I will get a copy of this form after I sign it.');
